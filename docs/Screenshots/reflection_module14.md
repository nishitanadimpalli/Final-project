Reflection – Module 14 Secure FastAPI Project

This project helped me understand how to build a complete, production-ready backend system using FastAPI. I learned not only how to implement API routes but also how authentication, security, validation, and database operations work together in a real application.

One of the most important parts of this assignment was implementing secure user authentication. I learned how to hash passwords, verify them safely, and generate JWT access tokens so the server can protect private routes. This made me understand how actual login systems work in real-world applications.

Building calculator CRUD operations helped reinforce how BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) patterns work with relational databases. I also learned how to structure clean CRUD functions and use SQLAlchemy ORM efficiently.

Testing was another major learning experience. I wrote and executed unit tests, integration tests, and browser-based end-to-end tests using Playwright. Seeing the tests automatically run inside GitHub Actions improved my confidence in CI pipelines and automated quality checks.

Finally, containerizing the application with Docker and integrating GitHub Actions to automatically build and push the image to Docker Hub made the project feel like a real professional deployment pipeline. I now understand how CI/CD works from committing code → running tests → deploying Docker images.

Overall, this assignment taught me backend development, security practices, automated testing, and DevOps workflows in a hands-on and practical way.
